    <p>I've collected the majority of projects and other assignments I did in COMP 250 below. There's short writeups on some of the more interesting ones, and some code samples where helpful. I hope you find something useful. Keep in mind that some of the projects dealing with PHP will break over time as changes are made to the server.</p>
    <p>The source code for all of this can be found on <a href="https://github.com/kjhx-hw/">GitHub</a>.</p>
