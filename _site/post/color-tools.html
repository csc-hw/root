You can have the best design your user has ever seen, but if the colors aren’t right – all is lost. The same is true of the opposite - good colors go unnoticed if your design is painful to use. Colors, and the tools you use to choose them, are everything.</p> <p>In most cases, you’ll want to approach color the same way you would any other web design challenge – it only needs to be changed if it fixes a specific problem. That said, going with good ol’ black and white will usually suffice. But for when you need an extra splash of color, you can’t exactly just go cherrypicking different colors you like – you have to be intentional with your choices. You have to keep several things in mind, such as contrast and color relationships. Here are a selection of tools that will make choosing your colors that much easier:</p> <h2 id="random-a11y">Random A11Y</h2> <p>This web tool is an ongoing project to try and curate beautiful color palettes that are a11y (accessibility) friendly. This tool generates a random palette and allows you to vote the combination up or down. It also can generate a whole pages worth of palettes for you to scroll through. It’s incredibly useful for getting quick color combinations, and it’s one I use all the time. I highly recommend it.</p> <p><a class="button" href="https://www.randoma11y.com">Use Random A11y</a></p> <h2 id="monochrome">Monochrome</h2> <p>This tool generates entire color palettes based off of just one color. It’s a lot more useful than it might seem – monochrome websites are quite tasteful when executed properly. The tool can also export your new color palette as a CSS mixin or in JSON, if you’d like.</p> <p><a class="button" href="https://monochrome.jxnblk.com/">Use Monochrome</a></p> <h2 id="coolors">Coolors</h2> <p>This website is a super fast color schemes generator. It has thousands of handpicked palettes submitted from users around the world. It’s very fast, simple to use, and can store your palettes in the cloud. You can even generate palettes from a picture, if that’s your thing. Coolors feels more geared towards graphic designers than web developers, but with a good eye for color you can take full advantage of this tool no problem.</p> <p><a class="button" href="https://coolors.co">Use Coolors</a></p> <h2 id="material-design-color-tool">Material Design Color Tool</h2> <p>If you’re familiar with Google’s Material Design, you already know what this tool is. It was intended to help developers pick a scheme from the Material color palette for apps. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it for generating palettes, but it has an accessibility measuring tool that is quite useful built in. This tool is more useful if you’re using the MDL framework to build a web app of some sort.</p> <p><a class="button" href="https://material.io/tools/color/">Use Material Design Color Tool</a></p> </div> </main> <footer> <div class="container"> <nav class="header"> <img src="/~khuggins/site//assets/images/khlc.png" title="Kyle Huggins" height="20rem" draggable="false"> <a href="mailto:kyle@huggins.io?subject=TAZ">kyle@huggins.io</a> </nav> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
