I built francisco so that I’d have a unified style system to base the rest of the websites we’d build this semester off of. Unfortunately, we never built another website again until the final project, <a href="#">Twister</a>, so I scrapped <em>this</em> framework and wrote another, simpler one that worked better for what we actually do in class. You can read more about that one <a href="/~khuggins/site/git/sharing-grund.html">here</a>.</p> <h3 id="animating-the-background">Animating the background</h3> <p>The thing I got the most compliments on was how the background image fades in when you load up the site. This was actually the simplest part of the website – the animation is pure CSS. My background element is in a <code>div</code> named <code>.jumbotron</code> – I have it in a separate <code>div</code> so that I can place it behind the rest of the page. The CSS for this whole element is:</p> <pre><code>.jumbotron {
        display: table;
        background-color: #000;
        background-image: url(media/ales-nesetril.jpg);
        background-size: cover;
        background-position: center;
        height: 100vh;
        width: 100%;
        -webkit-animation: fadein 4s; /* this line is important! */
      }
</code></pre> <p>The important part (for the animation) is the <code>-webkit-animation</code> tag. It’s important to remember that this will only work on WebKit based browsers – however, McCown only requires that this work in Chrome, as per the rubric. This tag contains the name of the animation (<code>fadein</code>). The name can be anything you want – I’m using <code>fadein</code> to maintain readability. The next piece is the length of time to perform it (<code>4s</code>). After this <code>.jumbotron</code> definition, we also have to define the <code>fadein</code> animation that we just referenced. Here’s what mine looks like:</p> <pre><code>@-webkit-keyframes fadein {
            from { opacity: 0; }
            to   { opacity: 1; }
        }
</code></pre> <p>Here, I define <code>fadein</code> as a type <code>@-webkit-keyframes</code> and then instruct the browser to translate it from an opacity of 0% to an opacity of 100%. And there you have it – your background now fades in from the background! If you want an easier way to animate different elements of your pages, I’d highly recomend using <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">animate.css</a> by <a href="https://github.com/daneden">@daneden</a>.</p> <h3 id="animating-link-effects">Animating link effects</h3> <p>Small touches make a huge difference in the overall feel that your website communicates to the user. One of the ways I do that here is by using “soft” link decoration on all my links. The most obvious way this is used in my project is in the navbars – the default color is grey, and when hovered over they fade up to flat white. This short animation is pure, glorious CSS. Here’s how it’s done:</p> <pre><code>a, a:visited {
  color: #ef5350;                   /* the normal color */
  text-decoration: none;
  transition: color .15s ease-in;   /* length of animation */
}

a:hover { color: #ff867c; }         /* the color it fades to */
</code></pre> <p>Don’t forget to include <code>text-decoration: none;</code> – it removes the default underline behavior for links. There are <a href="https://codemyui.com/tag/link/">a bunch</a> of fascinating effects you can add to links (and just about any other element for that matter) with pure CSS – when used properly, they can have a huge impact on the user experience of the site!</p> <h3 id="on-using-css-frameworks">On using CSS frameworks</h3> <p>Firstly, if you want to use francisco, <em>I cannot recommend it</em>. I wrote it in a week, the documentation isn’t the best, and I haven’t really touched it since I finished this project. It is a very sparse toolkit that was written for a very narrow scope of use cases. Additionally, it doesn’t work well in FireFox, but we don’t talk about that. If you want to use a CSS framework, here are a handful that I recomend:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://basscss.com">Basscss</a></li> <li><a href="http://getskeleton.com">Skeleton</a></li> <li><a href="https://tachyons.io">Tachyons</a></li> <li><a href="https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/">Spectre</a></li> <li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a></li> </ul> <h3 id="static-site-generators">Static site generators</h3> <p>A website like this one repeats itself a lot. Every page has the same <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, the same navbar, the same footer, you get the point. Making a change to one of these parts of your website means that you have to go manually change every other page in your site – it’s a huge pain. Enter the Static Site Generator, a better way to build static websites. This makes it incredibly easy to build websites that have a lot of repetitive content. In fact, the website you’re reading right now was written on one called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. It allows me to build a website in pieces – I can create set HTML shards for things such as headers or footers and then I can have Jekyll put that together with my content and generate a consistent website that is ready to use. This object-y method of building websites makes it far easier and far quicker to build large websites like this one.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we never built another static website in this class. From here on out, it’ll be one-pagers that test your understanding of specific programming concepts. A tool like Jekyll is no good when all you’re building is a single page. However, if you have time to master tools like Jekyll, it can make building websites far more enjoyable in the future!</p> </div> </main> <footer> <div class="container"> <nav class="header"> <img src="/~khuggins/site//assets/images/khlc.png" title="Kyle Huggins" height="20rem" draggable="false"> <a href="mailto:kyle@huggins.io?subject=TAZ">kyle@huggins.io</a> </nav> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
