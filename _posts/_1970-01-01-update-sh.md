If you’ve ever peeked into my home directory on TAZ, you’ve probably noticed some seemingly wack organization and a lot of symlinked files and directories. A lot of it has to do with update.sh, a script in my home folder that helps me keep everything updated without messing with WinSCP and without having to directly edit what lives on the server. I feel that this is the easier way to handle transferring my files to TAZ, so I’d like to explain it here.
If you could look into my public_html directory right now, you’d probably see something like this:

```
[khuggins@taz public_html]$ ls -l
drwx------. 2 khuggins apache   6 Jul 28  2013 cgi-bin
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 khuggins student 12 Oct 22 13:27 css -> git/root/css
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 khuggins student 15 Oct 10 20:30 dolphin.exe -> git/door-prizes
drwxr-xr-x. 6 khuggins student 64 Oct 22 13:23 git
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 khuggins student 19 Oct 22 13:25 index.html -> git/root/index.html
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 khuggins student 31 Oct 22 12:37 survey.html -> git/meta/php-survey/survey.html
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 khuggins student 30 Oct 22 12:35 survey.php -> git/meta/php-survey/survey.php
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 khuggins student 12 Sep  3 17:01 website -> git/website/
```

All of my files are actually links to files in other directories — all the same directory, actually.
